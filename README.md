This bot is designed to automate (and therefore speed up) the work with DOCX contracts for commercial companies. It fills in documents based on a template and saves them as a fully completed DOCX document, with the data entered through the Telegram chat.

The current version supports 6 templates:

- **One-time supply contract for individuals/legal entities**
- **Annual supply contract for individuals/legal entities**
- **Mutual beneficial services contract for individuals/legal entities**
